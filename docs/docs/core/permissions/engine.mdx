# Permission Engine

## Summary

The permission engine is an entity capable of managing complex permission operations and dealing with business rules.

Its goal is to provide a default implementation that can be customized and augmented by higher level implementations.

For instance, at Strapi we're using different encapsulations of the default permission engine to power our various auth systems (RBAC, content-API)

```mermaid
graph relation engine + rbac + content api
```

## Design

```mermaid
graph showing the structure of the engine
```

Talk about abilities, permissions, registries, etc...

## Generating an ability

```mermaid
graphql explaining how the generateAbility works
```

Flow when generating an ability, different hooks, allowed customizations, etc...

## Usage

The `@strapi/permissions` exports a factory allowing anyone to create a new instance of a default permission engine.

To test it, use the following snippet

```js
const { engine } = require('@strapi/permissions');

const myEngine = engine.new(/** ... */);
```
