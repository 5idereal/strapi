# API Tokens üîë

## Summary

The "API Tokens" feature aims to implement granularity to the content API‚Äôs token auth strategy by **enabling token customization**.

This customization happens thanks to different components:

- Granular permissions (_√† la_ Users & Permissions)
- Custom expiration date (tokens are created with a lifespan)

New features also include:

- Token regeneration (invalidate old access key and provide a new one)
- "last used at" timestamp now on each token that updates whenever a token is successfully authenticated
- More precise RBAC integration

> On a lower level, it has also been decided to bring more consistency to the auth strategies by **abstracting the notion of a Strapi ‚Äúpermission engine‚Äù** and using it as a basis to create more precise implementations that match business needs in different locations (Admin API with RBAC, Content API with Users & Permissions and API Token, ‚Ä¶). It should also bring consistency and a better developer experience for potential new auth systems that are yet to be developed.
